# Final Year Design - Decarbonised Steel Production

Reactor design code for my final year design project which simulates a fluidized bed water-gas shift reactor. The reactor is the first step in the treatment of blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace off gases by reacting carbon monoxide with water, forming carbon dioxide and hydrogen in a highly temperature controlled environment. A bed of small catalyst spheres (100um) is fluidized by the flow velocity of the gas providing excellent heat and mass transfer properties.

Requires ```Julia 1.5+``` and the packages ```YAML, DifferentialEquations, Sundials, Plots```
